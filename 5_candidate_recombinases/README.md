## 5 - Candidate recombinases search

Files in this folder were used to construct the presence-abscence matrix that allowed the detection of piPolB-associated recombinases. The script "cluster_association_pipolb.py" will calculate the observed difference of integrase frequency in the distinct piPolB clusters and will compare that value against 1000 random simulations. The R scripts included are used to plot the matrix of associated recombinases along the tips of the piPolB phylogeny.
