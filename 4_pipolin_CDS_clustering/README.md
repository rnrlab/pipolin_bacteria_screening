## 4 - Clustering of CDSs encoded in pipolins

This folder contains the scripts necesary to replicae the clustering of proteins predicted in pipolins using MMSeqs2. 
Scripts for CDS reannotation (based in clusters) are also included. Script "pipolin_delimit.py" will take pipolin sequence and delimit them to keep only the sequence with the near DRs to the piPolB by each side or use alternative integration spots.
